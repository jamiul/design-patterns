## The Builder Pattern
The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern used for constructing complex objects step by step.It is particularly useful when an object needs to be created with many optional components or configurations.

## Key Components of the Builder Pattern:
Product: The complex object that is being built.

Builder: An interface or abstract class that defines the steps to build the product.

Concrete Builder: Implements the Builder interface and provides specific implementations for the construction steps. It also keeps track of the constructed object.

Director: Controls the construction process by using the Builder interface. It knows the steps to construct the product but delegates the actual construction to the Builder.

## Explanation:
Product (Car): Represents the complex object we want to build.

Builder (CarBuilder): Defines the steps to build the Car.

Concrete Builder (ConcreteCarBuilder): Implements the steps and constructs the Car.

Director (CarDirector): Encapsulates the construction logic and uses the builder to create specific types of cars.

## Benefits of the Builder Pattern:
Flexibility: You can create different representations of the same object.

Separation of Concerns: The construction process is separated from the representation.

Reusability: The same construction process can be reused to create different objects.

This pattern is especially useful when dealing with objects that have many optional parameters or configurations.
